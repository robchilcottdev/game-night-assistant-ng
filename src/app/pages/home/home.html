        <span>Welcome to Game Night Assistant! Pick a game below to start keeping score. If you want to trigger your
            Home Assistant scripts based on game events
            (like when a certain score is reached, a player is eliminated or a game-specific event happens), click the
            <strong>Script settings</strong> button at the bottom of the screen to
            choose your scripts.

                <p>Records a list of players and their scores. Trigger options include running scripts when a certain
                    score is reached,
                    when a player is removed from the game, and when a player scores zero. Ideal for general
                    score-keeping and helping to run quiz night.
